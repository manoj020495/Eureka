Hi Dasu,

I checked the new updates from **Camunda** about moving from **Camunda 7 to Camunda 8**.
Looks like they added three tools for this —

---

**1. Migration Analyzer & Diagram Converter**
This one has a small web screen (UI) and can also run on our system like a Spring Boot app.
It helps change C7 BPMN models to C8 models.
It also updates expressions, variables, and delegate parts to match what C8 accepts.

---

**2. OpenRewrite Recipes**
This is a library kind of tool.
It changes delegate methods into job workers just by adding a plugin in our project.
It also handles variable changes automatically.
Only thing — it doesn’t move JUnit test cases yet.

---

**3. Data Migrator**
This runs as a simple Java program (standalone).
It moves running instances from C7 to C8.
Runtime data part is ready for production use,
but history data part is still in testing stage.
Needs Java 21 or higher.

---

Each tool looks good, but we need to try them properly to see how well they work —
like whether they handle only simple processes or even complex ones.
